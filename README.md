# Rock-Paper-Scissors-java


This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game. The program calls for user input, the only options being rock, paper, scissors, or by typing "quit" the player may exit the game. 
The computer plays by generating 3 random numbers, each of which is associated with either rock, paper or scissors. After the player and computer each have their move, the program determines if the user won, lost or tied with the computer. Finally the program waits 3 seconds to restart.
